# BaKa's Blogs - A React Application

Welcome to the repository for **BaKa's Blogs**, a dynamic blogging platform built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Strapi.

## Overview

This project leverages the power of modern technologies to provide a fast, efficient, and user-friendly blogging platform. Here's a brief overview of the technologies used:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to create reusable UI components.
- **Vite**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It offers features like hot module replacement and fast refresh.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
- **Strapi**: An open-source headless CMS that developers can use to build, deploy, and manage content-rich applications in no time.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies using your package manager of choice. You'll also need to set up a Strapi backend and configure it to work with this application.

Stay tuned for more detailed setup instructions and documentation!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
